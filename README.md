### AI for Grievance Redressal in Public Governance

Public governance bodies receive thousands of citizen grievances every day, covering issues such as civic infrastructure, sanitation, public safety, utilities, healthcare, education, and administrative delays.

These complaints are typically:

- Unstructured (free-text, voice notes, mixed languages)
- Manually reviewed and routed
- Slow to resolve, leading to backlogs, citizen dissatisfaction, and lack of accountability

The absence of intelligent prioritization and analysis causes critical grievances to be delayed, while authorities struggle to gain actionable insights from large volumes of complaint data.

There is a pressing need for an AI-powered grievance redressal system that can intelligently understand, categorize, and prioritize citizen complaints to enable faster, fairer, and more transparent governance.

### Objective

Design and develop an AI-driven grievance redressal platform using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and intelligent automation that can:

- Automatically analyze and classify citizen complaints
- Prioritize grievances based on urgency, severity, and impact
- Route complaints to the appropriate department or authority
- Assist government bodies in resolving issues efficiently and transparently

## ✅ Project Overview

Team Byteblazers presents a cutting-edge grievance management platform developed during the Vibe Coding Hackathon. This project leverages AI technologies to streamline grievance submission, analysis, and resolution processes. The platform is designed to enhance user experience for both citizens and officers, ensuring efficient and transparent grievance handling.

### Key Features

- **AI Receptionist**: A multi-channel intake system that uses NLP to instantly structure messy inputs (voice, text, images) into standard digital forms, eliminating manual data entry.
- **Intelligent Routing**: AI Agents automatically analyze context and route tickets to the exact department and officer instantly, ending the administrative "ping-pong" effect.
- **Automated Prioritization**: Real-time severity scoring ensures critical safety hazards (e.g., live wires) are flagged immediately for urgent action, separating them from routine issues.
- **Total Transparency**: An Anti-Corruption layer uses Computer Vision to verify "Before vs. After" photos, preventing "ghost resolutions" and restoring citizen trust.
